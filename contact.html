      </p>My name is Nimisha and I am a Rising Sophomore at UMass Boston majoring in I.T. with a focus in Business Intelligence. My role in programming this website was conducting the HTML and CSS Code for the flip-cards on the "Pizza Menue" page and altering any other spacing/margin-size problems with the website as a whole. I also took care of coding the HTML and CSS for the Navigation Bar at the top.  Feel free to contact me through: nimisha.thakkar001@umb.edu

      </p>My name is Matthew Crenshaw and I am the creativity behind the idea of the website. This pizza place is close to my heart and I thought it would be a great idea to make a website for it. So, I pitched the idea to my teammates and we all loved it. I am responsible for the content of the pictures and the descriptions behind them, of the different types of pizzas, and incorporating such into the website code.
